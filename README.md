# computer-vision

Computer vision requires images to be preprocessed so as to get the most accurate output.
The preprocessing code would essentially convert and crop out only the important part of the image.
If a page from a book needs to be processed. Then only the part of the page that has words can be extracted.

Detects a bottle and the area of the bottle compared to the whole image
Requires the image to be preprocessed and sent with the image that only has the bottle.
The bottle's colour is found dynamically and an average colour range is calculated.

Experiments :
  All files are experimental code that can be used for processing Images later on.
